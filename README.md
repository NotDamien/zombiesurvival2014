This is the 2014 build of Zombie Survival right before the 2018 Zombie Survival Update.

What is the whole point of this?
 
  This is for people who want to start a community and server and start out fresh and do whatever they want so you
  don't have to use a shitty gamemode someone tried to recreate into their own work. This will give players who have 
  wanted to make something on their own a chance to do it without the 2018 update or someone elses shitty remake.

Includes:
- Updated Health HUD
- Different Font

   If you do plan on hosting this gamemode on a dedicated server, or shared, whatever I would go here instead so you 
   can just download it from here and drag and drop.



   I will not be updating this, what you do beyond this point is all you, be creative and have fun :-)
